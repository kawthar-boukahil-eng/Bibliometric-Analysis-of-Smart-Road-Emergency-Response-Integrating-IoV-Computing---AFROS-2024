# Bibliometric Analysis of Smart Road Emergency Response Integrating IoV Computing
### AFROS Conference 2024

This repository contains the IEEE academic article titled *"Bibliometric Analysis of Smart Road Emergency Response Integrating IoV Computing"*, accepted for presentation at the AFROS Conference 2024. The paper examines the role of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) computing in enhancing emergency response systems on smart roads through the use of cloud, edge, and fog computing technologies.

## Overview
The integration of IoV computing within modern transportation infrastructure is essential for building smart road emergency response systems that can rapidly detect and respond to incidents. This research offers:
- A bibliometric analysis of relevant literature from IEEE Xplore.
- Data visualization and statistical insights into trends in publication, authorship, and institutional contributions to the field of IoV and ITS.
